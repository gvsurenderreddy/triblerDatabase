triblerDB v20150416 - John Moran (john@jtmoran.com)

triblerDB parses the "tribler.sdb" SQLite database used by the Tribler 
P2P application and displays all torrent files downloaded and searches
performed by the user.

Output is two files, "tribler_downloads.csv" and "tribler_searches.csv".

This script is has been tested up to Tribler v6.4.

If you receive an error stating that the file is encrypted or not a 
database, make sure the version of the sqlite3.dll file in your Python
DLLs directory is from the most current version of SQLite.

Options:
  
   -f, --file           Path to the tribler.sdb file
   -o, --output         Output directory (Default: current directory)
